- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThtgrlyJ
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to read this ish.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning random ish that I haven't made complete sense of yet.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on??? I have no freaking clue, but a colabo sounds dope. Maybe I can rap and y'all can beatbox???
- 📫 How to reach me jess72009@outlook.com or Jwtfhello@gmail.com...I got locked out of a million accounts and my business account Artwear etc.(check my jewelry yo) so I just keep making new ones. Over and over and over and over and losing all my pics, docs, or whatever. It's really freaking great. Love it. Not. So in case someone actually cares I'm alive, A BIG FYI- I will probs have different email addresses by next week or as soon as tomorrow.
